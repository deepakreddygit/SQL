1) Star Schema:

        This is the simplest and most effective schema in a data warehouse. A fact table in the center surrounded by multiple dimension tables resembles
a star in the Star Schema model.The fact table maintains one-to-many relations with all the dimension tables. 
Every row in a fact table is associated with its dimension table rows with a foreign key reference.
Due to the above reason, navigation among the tables in this model is easy for querying aggregated data.
An end-user can easily understand this structure. Hence all the Business Intelligence (BI) tools greatly support the Star schema model.
While designing star schemas the dimension tables are purposefully de-normalized. They are wide with many attributes to store the contextual data 
for better analysis and reporting.


2) SnowFlake Schema:

       Star schema acts as an input to design a SnowFlake schema. Snow flaking is a process that completely normalizes all the dimension tables from a star schema.
The arrangement of a fact table in the center surrounded by multiple hierarchies of dimension tables looks like a SnowFlake in the SnowFlake schema model. 
Every fact table row is associated with its dimension table rows with a foreign key reference.While designing SnowFlake schemas the dimension tables are purposefully
 normalized. Foreign keys will be added to each level of the dimension tables to link to its parent attribute. The complexity of the SnowFlake schema is directly proportional
 to the hierarchy levels of the dimension tables.
