A data warehouse:

       It is a central data repository used for reporting and data analysis.
 It can connect to and integrate multiple data sources to provide a common area to generate business insights.

A data warehouse (often abbreviated as DW or DWH) is a system used for reporting and data analysis from various sources to provide business insights.
 It operates as a central repository where information arrives from various sources.
Once in the data warehouse, the data is ingested, transformed, processed, and made accessible for use in decision-making.
The three main types of data warehouses are enterprise data warehouse (EDW), operational data store (ODS), and data mart.


History of Data Warehouses:

     The concept of data warehouses first came into use in the 1980s when IBM researchers Paul Murphy and Barry Devlin developed the
 business data warehouse. American computer scientist Bill Inmon is considered the “father” of the data warehouse due to his authorship of several works, 
such as the Corporate Information Factory and other topics on the building, usage, and maintenance of the data warehouse.
