CHARACTER :

The CHARACTER data type accepts character strings, including Unicode, of a fixed length. 
The length of the character string should be specified in the data type declaration; 
for example, CHARACTER(n) where n represents the desired length of the character string.
 If no length is specified during the declaration, the default length is 1.

VARCHAR :


The VARCHAR data type accepts character strings, including Unicode, of a variable length is up to the maximum length specified in the data type declaration.

A VARCHAR declaration must include a positive integer in parentheses to define the maximum allowable character string length. 
For example, VARCHAR(n) can accept any length of character string up to n characters in length. The length parameter may take any value from 1 to the current table page size.
 Attempting to assign a value containing more characters than the defined maximum length results in the truncation of the character string to the defined length. 
If any of the truncated characters are not blank, an error is raised.



BOOLEAN:


The BOOLEAN data type supports the storage of two values: TRUE or FALSE. No parameters are required when declaring a BOOLEAN data type.

Use the case insensitive keywords TRUE or FALSE to assign a value to a BOOLEAN data type. Comparisons using the BOOLEAN data type should also use these keywords.
 If you attempt to assign any other value to a BOOLEAN data type, an error is raised.


SMALLINT:


The SMALLINT data type accepts numeric values with an implied scale of zero. It stores any integer value between the range 2^ -15 and 2^15 -1.
 Attempting to assign values outside this range causes an error.

If you assign a numeric value with a precision and scale to a SMALLINT data type, the scale portion truncates, without rounding.


NUMERIC:


PointBase treats the NUMERIC data type in exactly the same way as the DECIMAL data type.
