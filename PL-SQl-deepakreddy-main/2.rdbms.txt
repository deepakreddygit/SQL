RDBMS stands for relational database management systemâ€”a software system that enables you to define, 
create, maintain, and control access to relational databases. It is the underlying part of the interface layer that helps you store and work with data.

 address the definition of a relational database to see what makes it so special.
 A relational database is the most popular type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. 
In relational databases, data is arranged and stored in tables consisting of columns and rows. And of course, you have the intuitive and flexible 
Structured Query Language to manipulate databases.


Data in relational databases is stored in a well-structured and easily understandable table format.
 Meanwhile, versatile relations between tables and the use of SQL to write queries of different complexity contribute to the flexibility of data management.

Relational databases provide multi-user access along with privileges that allow database administrators to have complete control over activities in databases and 
grant different levels of access to other users.

ACID (which comprises Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a well-known set of properties of database transactions meant to guarantee data validity despite errors, 
failures, and other possible mishaps. Relational databases deliver full ACID support.
