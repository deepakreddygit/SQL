Updatable Cursors
After defining a cursor using declare cursor, the SAP ASE server determines whether the cursor is updatable or read-only.

If:

A cursor is updatable – you can update or delete rows through the cursor; that is, use cursor_name to do a position update or delete.

A cursor is read-only – you cannot use cursor_name to perform a position update or delete.

Use the for update or for read only clause to explicitly define a cursor as updatable or read-only. You cannot define an updatable cursor if its select_statement contains one of the following constructs:
distinct option

group by clause

Aggregate function

Subquery

union operator

at isolation read uncommitted clause
