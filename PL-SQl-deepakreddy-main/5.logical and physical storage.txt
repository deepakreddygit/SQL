Logical vs. Physical Storage Structures
Data independence is a primary characteristic of a relational database system such as Oracle. An Oracle database's physical structure is 
independent of and hidden from an end user's logical view of the data. The benefit of data independence is that typical end users and application 
developers can easily access data in logical structures such as tables by using simple SQL commands, without having to consider the complexities of 
the data's physical storage. For example, when you execute a query that targets a table, you don't have to consider where the table's data is stored on disk, 
because Oracle transparently maps columns and rows of the table's data to files and physical bytes on disk



An Oracle database is made up of physical and logical structures. Physical structures are those that can be seen and operated on from the operating system, 
such as the physical files that store data on disk.

Logical structures are created and recognized by the Oracle database server and are not known to the operating system. 
The primary logical structure in a database, a tablespace, contains physical files. The applications developer or end user may be aware of the logical structure, 
but is not usually aware of this physical structure. The DBA must understand the relationship between the physical and logical structures of a database.
