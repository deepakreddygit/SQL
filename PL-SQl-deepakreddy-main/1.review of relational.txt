A relational database is a database organized according to the relational model of data. In simple terms, 
the relational model defines a set of relations (which we can think of as analogous to tables) 
and describes the relationships, or connections, 
between them in order to determine how the data stored in them can interact. Using the relational model
 elevates our database from data that is represented in just a flat, two-dimensional table, 
to one where we can describe the data in a more complex and detailed way. Using a relational database helps us to cut down on duplicated data and provides a much more useful data structure for us to interact with.

A relational database management system, or RDBMS, is essentially a software application, or system,
 for managing relational databases. An RDBMS allows a user, or another application, to interact with a database by issuing commands 
using syntax that conforms to a certain set of conventions or standards.
